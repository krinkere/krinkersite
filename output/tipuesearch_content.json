Anyway, if you have wired Windows printer and don't want to upgrade just yet here is what you need to do: On Windows PC 1. Establish user account on your PC. This was one thing that I had to do to make everything that should work to actually work. This is as easy as opening your control panel and clicking on Add user in your Users menu. For more tricks see this: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/10325/manage-user-accounts-in-windows-home-server/ 2. Now onto actual set up... Select Start->Devices and Printers. Right click on the printer that you want to share, and either pick share or properties and then pick sharing tab. Make sure that share check box is selected and make sure that you note down the name of the printer. 3. Open command prompt. Use ipconfig command to find your PC's IP. To summarize this part. You have IP address and name of the printer to connect to and you have the credentials that you created in step 1. On MAC 1. Open System Preferences and locate Printers and Scanners icon. Click! 2. Select + under printers to add new printer, i.e. wired Windows printer. 3. Right click on the menu and select Customize Toolbar and add Advanced 4. Click on Advanced. For type select Windows printer via spoolss 5. For URL provide IP and printer name that you have... so the link looks like smb://192.138.1.13/printer_name (Replace any spaces with %20 in your 6. Under Choose a driver or Printer Model pick your printer type (I did not see my exact model so I picked closes HP model instead. Worked) 7. At this point your PC printer will be connected to your Mac. Testing Select something to print on your Mac... in my case, the first time it tried to print it asked for my PC username/password which we created previously, after that it was stored in my keychain and was never an issue again. That's it! Hope it helps and once again, let me know if you have further questions, etc.","title":"Accessing wired Windows printer from your Mac"},{"tags":"Tutorial","url":"Lucene_scoring_examplained.html","text":"Several good books already explain what Lucene scoring really means and how it is calculated in great detail with lots of basic concepts explain. In this, post I am going to try to keep it high level for people already familiar with the basics and go straight for the scoring overview. The factors involved in Lucene's scoring algorithm are as follows: 1. tf = term frequency in document = measure of how often a term appears in the document 2. idf = inverse document frequency = measure of how often the term appears across the index 3. coord = number of terms in the query that were found in the document 4. lengthNorm = measure of the importance of a term according to the total number of terms in the field 5. queryNorm = normalization factor so that queries can be compared 6. boost (index) = boost of the field at index-time 7. boost (query) = boost of the field at query-time The implementation, implication and rationales of factors 1,2, 3 and 4 in DefaultSimilarity.java, which is what you get if you don't explicitly specify a similarity, are: note: the implication of these factors should be read as, \"Everything else being equal, … \" tf Implementation: sqrt(freq) Implication: the more frequent a term occurs in a document, the greater its score Rationale: documents which contains more of a term are generally more relevant idf Implementation: log(numDocs/(docFreq+1)) + 1 Implication: the greater the occurrence of a term in different documents, the lower its score Rationale: common terms are less important than uncommon ones coord Implementation: overlap / maxOverlap Implication: of the terms in the query, a document that contains more terms will have a higher score Rationale: self-explanatory lengthNorm Implementation: 1/sqrt(numTerms) Implication: a term matched in fields with less terms have a higher score Rationale: a term in a field with less terms is more important than one with more queryNorm is not related to the relevance of the document, but rather tries to make scores between different queries comparable. It is implemented as 1/sqrt(sumOfSquaredWeights) So, roughly speaking (quoting Mark Harwood from the mailing list), Documents containing all the search terms are good Matches on rare words are better than for common words Long documents are not as good as short ones Documents which mention the search terms many times are good The mathematical definition of the scoring can be found in org.apache.lucene.search.Class Similarity Customizing scoring Its easy to customize the scoring algorithm. Just subclass DefaultSimilarity and override the method you want to customize. For example, if you want to ignore how common a term appears across the index, Similarity sim = new DefaultSimilarity () { public float idf ( int i , int i1 ) { return 1 ; } } and if you think for the title field, more terms is better Similarity sim = new DefaultSimilarity () { public float lengthNorm ( String field , int numTerms ) { if ( field . equals ( \"title\" )) return ( float ) ( 0.1 * Math . log ( numTerms )); else return super . lengthNorm ( field , numTerms ); } }","title":"Lucene scoring examplained"},{"tags":"How To article","url":"How_to_find_a_file_containing_particular_text_in_Linux.html","text":"Here is a quick example: $ grep -r \"text string to search\" directory-path To search for a string ‘logged in' in all text (*.log) files located in /etc/networks/ directory for example, use: $ grep \"logged in\" /etc/networks/*.log To search all subdirectories recursively, include -r option like so: $ grep -r \"logged in\" /etc/networks/*.log The grep command prints the matching lines for each match.
