Pass -H option to print the filename only: $ grep -H -r \"logged in\" /etc/networks/*.log To search for two or more words, use egrep: egrep -w -r 'logged in|logged out' /etc/networks/*.log To hide warning spam of permission for certain directories being denied, etc, send them to dev/null: $ grep -w -r 'logged in|logged out' /etc/networks/*.log 2 >/dev/null To make it case insensitive, use -i option: $ grep -i \"logged in\" /etc/networks/*.log","title":"How to find a file containing particular text in Linux"}]}
